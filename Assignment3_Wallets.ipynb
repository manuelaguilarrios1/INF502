        "This chunk of code will create an empty array of 5. It will then enter a for loop of 5 iterations. At the start of each iteration, the typeWallet variable will be initialized to str so that the we can go into the while loop. Inside the while loop the code will try prompting the user for a float value for a specific wallet. If the user enters something else, like a str, it will then become a value error and execute the except which will give an error message and set typeWallet to str. Setting the typeWallet to str will bring us back to through the while loop and ask the user for a float value for that specific wallet. This will happen for 5 wallet values and give us a list of 5 wallets.  "
